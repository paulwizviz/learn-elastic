# Query

Query is a search mechanism to help you improve the precision of your search.

## Syntax

```
GET <index>/_search
{
    "query":{
        ...
    }
}
```

## Match Query

The syntax is as follows:

```
"query":{
    "match":
        "<field>": {
            "query": <matching criteria>
        }
}
```

Example document:

```
POST /my-index/_doc
{
    "id": "park_rocky-mountain",
    "title": "Rocky Mountain",
    "description": "Bisected north to south by the Continental Divide, this portion of the Rockies has ecosystems varying from over 150 riparian lakes to montane and subalpine forests to treeless alpine tundra."
}
```

Example query:
